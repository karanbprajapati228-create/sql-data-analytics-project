Customer Report
=======================================================================================================
Purpose:
    - This report consolidates key customer metrics and behaviors

Highlights:
    1. Gathers essential fields such as names, ages, and transaction details.
    2. Segments customers into categories (VIP, Regular, New) and age groups.
    3. Aggregates customer-level metrics:
        - total orders
        - total sales
        - total quantity purchased
        - total products
        - lifespan (in months)
    4. Calculates valuable KPIs:
        - recency (months since last order)
        - average order value
        - average monthly spend
